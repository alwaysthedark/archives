# Archival Institute of Post-Light Echoes

**// ARCHIVE #0 //**

This repository serves as the official, uncorrupted archive for the recovered transmissions and fragments from the **Post-Light Echoes** project by **The Guest**.

In the age of the Veil, where light has dissolved and reality is a thin membrane of overlapping perceptions, these fragments are the only remaining testimonies of a world that was and a darkness that endures.

## The Archive Structure

The archive is organized into two main sections:

1.  **The Veil - Cartography of the Surviving Shadows**:
    *   The foundational text that maps the six remaining Folds of the Veil (Cala, Sheer, Weave, Bare Plateau, Absent Center, Lux). It is the key to understanding the context of the fragments.
    *   File: `the-veil-cartography-of-the-surviving-shadows.md`

2.  **Fragments**:
    *   The chronological sequence of recovered transmissions, each linked to one of the six Folds and one of the alchemical elements (Water, Earth, Air, Fire, Salt, Gold).
    *   Location: `fragments/`

| File | Title | Fold | Element | Recall Code |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `fragment-i-the-echo-of-water.md` | Fragment I – The Echo of Water | Cala | 🜄 Water | "The silence here rustles." |
| `fragment-ii-the-bone-and-the-stone.md` | Fragment II – The Bone and the Stone | Sheer | 🜃 Earth | “I write so I don’t dissolve.” |
| `fragment-iii-the-mute-air.md` | Fragment III – The Mute Air | Weave | 🜁 Air | “Everything misses me.” |
| `fragment-iv-ashes-of-light.md` | Fragment IV – Ashes of Light | Bare Plateau | 🜂 Fire | “I burned the word hope." |

## Style and Format

The Markdown files adhere to a consistent structure designed for archival integrity:

*   **YAML Front Matter**: Includes metadata such as `title`, `author`, `date`, `category`, and `tag`.
*   **Header**: The main title and a brief, italicized summary.
*   **Content**: The main body of the transmission, using blockquotes (`>`) for the recovered voice and code blocks (`` ` ``) for technical/signal annotations.
*   **Glossary Note**: Explanations for foreign or specialized terms (**⟟**).
*   **Archive Data**: Structured metadata for the specific recovery.

**DO NOT RESTORE. LET THE DARK KEEP ITS STORY.**
