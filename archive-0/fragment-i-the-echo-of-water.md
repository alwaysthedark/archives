# Fragment I – The Echo of Water

*Recovered from the flooded sector known as the Cala. A voice listens through the dark water — not seeking memory, but weight. Each word dissolves, yet remains.*

**🜄 Water**

`[File 1.VI / Cala sector / Rain Pool / Signal continuity: 63%]`

Recovered beside a collection basin in the Cala. Initial traces on ceramic and tile; readable only under indirect light. the Guest re-transcribed using opaque gloves.

> Just listening.
> For days.

Hands in the water that doesn’t move. It remembers more than I do. Every ripple is a hesitation, a thought that refused to dissolve.
`[background hum: low metallic]`

Since the sounds turned viscous, every word slides down my skin. Even silence feels damp. The air smells of sleep and metal.

I see my face each time I close my eyes. It isn’t the same. Maybe I’ve stopped having one.

There was a time when gestures had signatures. We said: today I’ve done much. We measured breath in productive minutes, worshipped exhaustion, tamed desire into schedules.

Then came the dark — not sudden, but spreading like a fever that starts with the skin, and ends by forgetting the heart.

> Now every act echoes.
> If I say love, the water answers sleep.
> If I say hunger, it sighs waiting.
> If I say home, it wets my lips and disappears.

And sometimes, between breaths, a word slips through — **utsuroi** — like a tide of memory turning inwards, too gentle to resist, too old to name.
`[microcurrent // temperature drift 0.8°C]`

The dark has no borders. But it has seams. And you can stitch them to your skin.

The voice stops after twenty-four beats.
The surface keeps moving, as if the body underneath were still breathing.
`[end of capture // interference cutoff]`

**Glossary Note:**
**⟟** `[language: Japanese]`
*utsuroi* (移ろい) — “the shifting of seasons, the passing of things”; used here to suggest change as a soft form of disappearance.

**Note from the Guest:**
The Cala still hums.
What we call silence is just
a language too slow for light.
